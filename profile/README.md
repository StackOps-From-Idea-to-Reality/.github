# 🚀 StackOps – From Idea to Reality

**StackOps** is a personal DevOps initiative by [Hemant Kumar]((https://github.com/HATAKEkakshi)), designed to showcase real-world infrastructure and automation practices through practical, production-style projects.

This initiative bridges the gap between DevOps theory and real implementation. Each project in StackOps combines Infrastructure as Code and Continuous Deployment into clean, modular, and scalable workflows — just like in the industry.

## 📌 What is StackOps?

StackOps is a growing series of end-to-end DevOps projects. Each one is treated as if it’s powering a real-world system, covering everything from cloud provisioning to deployment automation:

- 🔧 **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** for cloud-native environments  
- 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines** for full automation and delivery  
- 📁 Clear separation between infrastructure and deployment code  
- 📘 Detailed documentation and blog posts provided with each project  

Projects are organized into **two repositories**:  
- `iac` – Infrastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform, Ansible, etc.  
- `cicd` – CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Docker, Helm, and more
