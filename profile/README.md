# 🚀 StackOps – From Idea to Reality

**👋 Hi, I’m Hemant — a pre-final year engineering student passionate about DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure.**

Welcome to the **StackOps Series** — my personal initiative where I document real-world DevOps projects, the challenges I faced, lessons learned, and the tools I’ve mastered along the way.

StackOps is more than just code — it’s my journey to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation. Every project here is built like it’s going into production: modular, scalable, and automated using modern DevOps practices like Infrastructure as Code and Continuous Deployment.

## 📌 What is StackOps?

StackOps is a growing series of hands-on DevOps projects designed to simulate real-world systems. Each one follows a complete DevOps lifecycle, combining:

- 🔧 Infrastructure provisioning (Terraform, Ansible, KOPS, etc.)
- 🚀 CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, Docker, Helm, etc.)
- 🧩 Clean separation of IaC and CI/CD in structured repos
- 📘 Accompanying blog posts with every project to explain the “why” behind every decision

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Hemant Kumar**, a pre-final (3rd year) engineering student who loves solving infrastructure problems and building automated systems.

StackOps is my way of learning in public — building, breaking, fixing, and documenting it all, so others can learn too.
